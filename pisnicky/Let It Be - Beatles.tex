And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer~-- let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer~-- let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow~-- let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom~-- let it be
