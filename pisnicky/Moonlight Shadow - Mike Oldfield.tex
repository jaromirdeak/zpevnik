The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watch your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
The stars move slowly in a silvery light
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
