Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched
on Puff's gigantic tail
noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
pirate ships would low'r their flag
when Puff roared out his name oh!

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
painted wings and giant rings
make way for other toys
one grey night it happened Jackie Paper came no more
and Puff that mighty dragon
he ceased his fearless roar oh!

His head was bent in sorrow green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
along the cherry lane
without his life-long friend Puff could not be brave
so Puff that mighty dragon
sadly slipped into his cave oh!
